# DisVar: An R library for identifying variants associated with diseases using personal genetic information

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
DisVar is an R package that finds diseases from a VCF file by comparing the variants in the VCF file with those in various databases. The package currently supports five databases: GWASdb, GRASP, GWAS Catalog, GAD, and Johnson and O'Donnell.

## Features

- Finds diseases from a VCF file by comparing the variants in the VCF file with those in various databases.

- Supports five databases: GWASdb, GRASP, GWAS Catalog, GAD, and Johnson and O'Donnell.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DisVar from [GitHub](https://github.com/) to install the package, you can use the `devtools` package and run the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Khunanon-Chanasongkhram/DisVar")
```
## Dependencies
The package depends on the following packages:

- `sqldf`
- `data.table`

## Usage

The main function in the package is `DisVar()`, which takes one arguments:

- `file`: the name of the VCF file.

The function returns a data frame containing variant information from various databases.

### Examples

Here's an example of how to use the function:

```{r example}
library(DisVar)
DisVar("file_name.vcf")
```

You will get this output file: `file_name`_diseases_output.txt

When you test the program with the test file (`file_name.vcf`), the results are shown in the following table.
